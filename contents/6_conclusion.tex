\section{Conclusion}


In this paper, we propose a method to enable faster and better learning by combining the skills learned in the pretrain phase.
The interesting thing is that it is better to have a skill weight regardless of the state than to have a different skill weight for each state.
Based on these results, we want to find a way to better utilize skill combinations such as attention in the future.
