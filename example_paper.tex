\begin{abstract}
Skill is an attempt to integrate pretrain-finetuning method in reinforcement learning.
During pretraining, the agent learns some useful and distinct policies without reward, and use this policy at finetuning to get fast and better performance than training from scratch.
However, there's few attempts to combine skills optimally at finetuning.
In this paper, we propose two skill combining methods which are sample-efficient and shows good performance.
First method is a state-agnostic super sample efficient method achieving higher reward than baseline methods adding only tens of parameters.
Second method is a state-aware skill combining method which is a slower-learner than first method but shows better performance at the end.
We improve second method's sample efficiency by using pretrained DIAYN module as a skill combining module.
Code is available at $https://github.com/some-private$.

% Camera-ready copies should have the title of the paper as running head
% on each page except the first one. The running title consists of a
% single line centered above a horizontal rule which is $1$~point thick.
% The running head should be centered, bold and in $9$~point type. The
% rule should be $10$~points above the main text. For those using the
% \textbf{\LaTeX} style file, the original title is automatically set as running
% head using the \texttt{fancyhdr} package which is included in the ICML
% 2022 style file package. In case that the original title exceeds the
% size restrictions, a shorter form can be supplied by using

% \verb|\icmltitlerunning{...}|

% just before $\mathtt{\backslash begin\{document\}}$.
% Authors using \textbf{Word} must edit the header of the document themselves.





% Acknowledgements should only appear in the accepted version.
% \section*{Acknowledgements}

% \textbf{Do not} include acknowledgements in the initial version of
% the paper submitted for blind review.

% If a paper is accepted, the final camera-ready version can (and
% probably should) include acknowledgements. In this case, please
% place such acknowledgements in an unnumbered section at the
% end of the paper. Typically, this will include thanks to reviewers
% who gave useful comments, to colleagues who contributed to the ideas,
% and to funding agencies and corporate sponsors that provided financial
% support.


% In the unusual situation where you want a paper to appear in the
% references without citing it in the main text, use \nocite
\nocite{langley00}

% This document was modified from the file originally made available by
% Pat Langley and Andrea Danyluk for ICML-2K. This version was created
% by Iain Murray in 2018, and modified by Alexandre Bouchard in
% 2019 and 2021 and by Csaba Szepesvari, Gang Niu and Sivan Sabato in 2022. 
% Previous contributors include Dan Roy, Lise Getoor and Tobias
% Scheffer, which was slightly modified from the 2010 version by
% Thorsten Joachims & Johannes Fuernkranz, slightly modified from the
% 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and Sam Roweis's 2008 version, which is
% slightly modified from Prasad Tadepalli's 2007 version which is a
% lightly changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew
% Moore, which was in turn edited from those of Kristian Kersting and
% Codrina Lauth. Alex Smola contributed to the algorithmic style files.
